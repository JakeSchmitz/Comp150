Follow along in class if you want to set up a VM with a hadoop cluster 
running Cloudera's Distribution of Hadoop and run MapReduce code written
in python.

The presentation will start with a walkthrough of setting up the VM for the
demo. See the attached PDF for more thorough instructions on this step.

Next we will open up the VM and open the terminal. Inside the terminal we 
will start up Cloudera Manager which is a web interface for administering
a Hadoop Cluster. To start CM, run sudo ~/cloudera-manager --force. 

Next open up firefox and go to Cloudera Manager using the shortcut in the 
toolbar. Login with the username and password as cloudera. When the homepage
loads (which may take a while) make sure the YARN component is started in
the left hand column.
